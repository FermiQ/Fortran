# asynchronous_io.f90

## Overview
This program demonstrates the use of asynchronous I/O operations in Fortran. It shows how to write data to a file asynchronously, allowing the program to perform other computations while the I/O operation is in progress. This can help in overlapping computation and I/O, thereby improving the performance of the code.

## Key Components
- `PROGRAM asynchronous_io`: The main program unit. It initializes an array `A`, writes it to a file "asynchronous_io.out" asynchronously, performs some operations on another array `B` using the `do_something_with` subroutine, waits for the asynchronous write to complete, and then performs operations on array `A`.
- `SUBROUTINE do_something_with(vector)`: A subroutine that takes a real array `vector` as input and fills it with random numbers.

## Important Variables/Constants
- `A(1000000)`: A real array of size 1,000,000. It is written to a file asynchronously.
- `B(1000)`: A real array of size 1,000. The subroutine `do_something_with` is called with this array while `A` is being written asynchronously.
- `id`: An integer variable used to identify the asynchronous I/O operation. It is used in the `WRITE` statement and the corresponding `WAIT` statement.
- `UNIT 10`: The file unit number associated with "asynchronous_io.out".

## Usage Examples
The program follows this workflow:
1. Opens a file named "asynchronous_io.out" for unformatted asynchronous output. The unit number 10 is associated with this file.
2. Initiates an asynchronous write of the array `A` to the file. The `id` variable is used to track this operation.
3. While the write operation for `A` is in progress, the subroutine `do_something_with` is called with array `B` to perform some computations (filling `B` with random numbers).
4. The program then executes a `WAIT` statement, which blocks further execution until the asynchronous write operation identified by `id` on unit 10 is complete.
5. After the write is complete, the file is closed.
6. The subroutine `do_something_with` is then called with array `A` (which has now been successfully written to the file).

This example illustrates how to perform computations (`do_something_with(B)`) concurrently with I/O operations (`WRITE (10, id=id, asynchronous='yes') A`).

## Dependencies and Interactions
This program is a self-contained example demonstrating an intrinsic Fortran I/O feature (asynchronous I/O). It does not have external library dependencies. It interacts with the file system by creating and writing to "asynchronous_io.out". The `random_number` intrinsic subroutine is used within `do_something_with`.
